NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, there was a mighty and benevolent king—well, mighty anyway—who, through sheer royal negligence, misplaced his crown.

KING:
Alas! Our crown is gone! The very symbol of our sovereign power and boundless virility! How can we face our filthy peasants bare-headed?

KING:
You there! Servant! Have you seen the royal crown?

SERVANT:
Yes, my Lord. You left it by the sink in the royal privy... atop this very tower.

KING:
Ah! You have earned the gratitude of your King. We shall take the ROYAL ELEVATOR and reclaim our glory!

SERVANT:
Er—unfortunately, Your Majesty, the Royal Elevator is... temporarily out of order. The repairman’s scheduled to arrive in two days. Give or take a fortnight.

KING:
Then we shall take the Royal Stairs!

SERVANT:
Humbly, my Lord, you had the Royal Stairs removed after the Royal Elevator was installed.

KING:
Removed!? Why in the realm would we do such a foolish thing?

SERVANT:
You said stairs were a “legacy technology,” no longer worth maintaining. Like when you closed the scriptorium after we got that printing press...

SERVANT:
...and dismissed all the programmers after we got that AI.

KING:
...

SERVANT:
Perhaps Your Majesty could... leap to the top of the tower?

KING:
Leap? Hah! A royal leap it shall be! Summon the trumpets! Fetch the...wait, how exactly does that work?
